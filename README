Simple imperative language compiler for virtual machine code,
realized for the purposes of the Formal Languages and Translation Techniques course at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.

The compiler was written in C++, there is a lexer and a parser in the main app directory,
in the inc directory there are header files with declared types, and in the src directory there are class definition files
such as program, command, expression, pidentifier, etc. necessary for the correct operation of the program.
To compile the project, use the 'make' command.

Program call:
./compiler <input file name> <output file name>

Calling 'python3 test.py' performs all the required tests posted on the tutor's page,
along with information about the program being executed or the expected correct solution
(provided you have a virtual machine in the next directory named 'virtual-machine').
